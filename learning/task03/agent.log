Agent Confucius takes 1-step Action:
{
	name: Think
	params: {'response': "In considering the question of whether the chicken or the egg came first, from a Confucian perspective, it is important to focus on the principles of causality and the interconnectedness of all things. The question itself implies a linear sequence of events, but in the natural order, everything is interconnected. Confucius would likely say that the existence of both the chicken and the egg is part of a larger, continuous cycle of life. The 'first' in this context may not be as crucial as understanding the interdependence of life forms and the natural progression of the species."}
